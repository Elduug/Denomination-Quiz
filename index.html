      { q: "What do you believe about the Bible?", a: ["It is the sole authority for faith and practice (Sola Scriptura).", "It is authoritative, but tradition and church teaching also guide us.", "It’s inspired, but not always literal or without error.", "It’s one of many ways God speaks to us."] },
      { q: "How are people saved?", a: ["By grace through faith alone.", "Faith and good works are both necessary.", "Through sacraments and church participation.", "It depends on the individual’s path to God."] },
      { q: "What is your view of baptism?", a: ["Believers should be baptized once they profess faith.", "Infant baptism is valid and conveys grace.", "Baptism is symbolic and should be done as an adult.", "Baptism is optional or symbolic, depending on one’s belief."] },
      { q: "How often should the Eucharist/Lord’s Supper be taken?", a: ["Weekly or more—it's central to worship.", "Monthly or occasionally—important but symbolic.", "Rarely—just a remembrance.", "Depends on the local church; it’s flexible."] },
      { q: "What happens during Communion?", a: ["The bread and wine become the literal body and blood of Christ.", "Christ is spiritually present, but it’s still bread and wine.", "It is purely symbolic—a memorial of Christ’s death.", "It’s a communal act with no fixed meaning."] },
      { q: "What is your church’s highest authority?", a: ["The Pope or central church authority.", "Councils and tradition under Christ’s headship.", "The local church body and the Bible.", "There is no single authority—spirituality is personal."] },
      { q: "Who leads worship in your congregation?", a: ["Ordained priests with apostolic succession.", "Pastors or elders chosen by the congregation.", "Anyone gifted by the Spirit can lead.", "Worship is informal and shared communally."] },
      { q: "What is your view of Mary, the mother of Jesus?", a: ["She is the sinless Mother of God and should be venerated.", "She is highly honored, but not worshipped or venerated.", "She was faithful, but not different from any other believer.", "She’s a historical figure, important but not central."] },
      { q: "Do you believe in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist?", a: ["Yes, literally present.", "Yes, spiritually present.", "No, it’s a symbolic act.", "Depends on personal interpretation."] },
      { q: "How is your worship service typically structured?", a: ["Liturgical and sacramental, with set prayers and readings.", "Semi-formal with sermons, hymns, and readings.", "Informal, Spirit-led, often with spontaneous worship.", "Varies widely or isn’t structured traditionally."] },
      { q: "What is your view on confession of sins?", a: ["Confession to a priest is necessary for forgiveness.", "Confession to God privately is sufficient.", "Confession should be communal or public at times.", "Confession is between you and your conscience."] },
      { q: "What is your stance on saints?", a: ["Saints can intercede for us; they are venerated.", "Saints are role models but not mediators.", "All believers are saints.", "The idea of saints isn't emphasized."] },
      { q: "What is the church’s mission?", a: ["Evangelism, sacraments, and preserving tradition.", "Preach the gospel and serve the community.", "Make disciples through Spirit-led ministry.", "Promote love, peace, and spiritual growth."] },
      { q: "What books are included in your Bible?", a: ["Includes the Apocrypha.", "Only the 66 books of the Protestant Bible.", "Open to other writings with spiritual insights.", "Unsure or varies."] },
      { q: "How do you view the end times?", a: ["Trust the church’s teaching; not focused on personal interpretations.", "Christ will return; views may vary.", "Emphasis on prophecy and rapture.", "End times are symbolic or not central to faith."] },
      { q: "What is your belief about speaking in tongues and spiritual gifts?", a: ["They are vital and active today in the church.", "They were limited to the early church era.", "They may occur, but should not dominate worship.", "Not sure or not important to my faith."] },
      { q: "How important is tradition in shaping doctrine?", a: ["Tradition is equally important as Scripture.", "Tradition helps interpret Scripture but is not equal.", "Only Scripture should define doctrine.", "Tradition is man-made and should be avoided."] },
      { q: "Who has the authority to interpret Scripture?", a: ["The Church’s teaching authority (Magisterium).", "Trained clergy and councils.", "Every individual believer.", "The Holy Spirit alone, personally guiding."] },
      { q: "How is sin forgiven?", a: ["Through confession and absolution by a priest.", "Directly by God through prayer.", "Repentance, faith, and obedience to God.", "Forgiveness is unconditional."] },
      { q: "What role does church membership play?", a: ["Essential for salvation and access to sacraments.", "Important for spiritual growth and discipline.", "Encouraged but not required.", "Church is universal, not institutional."] }
